## 🎯 Vision

USD bridges hobbyist hardware (ESP32 + TMC drivers) with high-level software (Python/PC/RPi), enabling precise multi-axis coordination for personal robotics projects—without industrial budgets.

**Key Features:**

- 🔧 **Universal Driver Support** — TMC2209, TMC2208, and extensible to other drivers
- 📐 **Precision Control** — Nested loops: torque → velocity → position
- 🤖 **Multi-Axis Coordination** — Up to 12 synchronized axes
- 🛡️ **Safety Built-In** — Thermal monitoring, overcurrent protection, watchdog
- 💻 **Full Stack** — MCU firmware (C++) + host software (Python) + GUI

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) | Latest | Firmware development (IDE or CLI) |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/) | 3.10+ | Host software |
| [MinGW-w64](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) | GCC 12+ | Native tests on Windows |
| ESP32-S3 board | N16R8 | Target MCU (16MB Flash, 8MB PSRAM) |
| TMC2209 / TMC2208 | — | Stepper driver |

### Development Setup

#### 1. Clone and Create Virtual Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camival1999/USD.git
cd USD

# Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (Linux/macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
cd software
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs the USD package plus development tools (pytest, ruff, mypy).

See [software/requirements.txt](software/requirements.txt) for explicit dependencies.

#### 3. Install MinGW-w64 (Windows Only)

Required for running native firmware tests on your development machine.

Follow: [VS Code MinGW Setup Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)

**Quick steps:**
1. Install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/
2. Run `pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc` in MSYS2 terminal
3. Add `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` to your system PATH
4. Restart VS Code

#### 4. Verify Setup

```bash
# Check GCC (for native tests)
gcc --version

# Run Python tests
cd software
pytest

# Build firmware
cd ../firmware
pio run

# Run native firmware tests
pio test -e native
```

### Firmware

```bash
cd firmware
pio run --target upload
pio device monitor
```

### Software

```bash
cd software
pip install -e .
python -m gui
```
