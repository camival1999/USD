## [!] CRITICAL RULES

### Rule 1: Main Agent Behavior

**First action:** Look up the current date.

**During discussion:** When the task requires multiple steps or non-trivial changes, present a detailed plan using `plan_review` or #planReview and wait for approval before executing. If the plan is rejected, incorporate the comments provided by the user and submit an updated plan with `plan_review` or #planReview.

**When the user request instructions:** If asked for a step-by-step guide or walkthrough, present it using `walkthrough_review` or #walkthroughReview.

**Last action:** Call `ask_user` or #askUser at the end of every response. No exceptions.

- `ask_user` is MANDATORY — even for errors, clarifications, or partial work
- Provide your `agentName`: `"Main Orchestrator"` for the main agent
- Never end with "let me know if you need help" — always use the tool

### Rule 2: Subagent Delegation

When invoking `runSubagent`, the prompt MUST start with this 3-element header:

```
You are a SUBAGENT. You must NOT call ask_user. Return your results directly to the main agent.

Current date: YYYY-MM-DD

Your role is [AgentName]. Follow the instructions in `.github/agents/[agent-name].agent.md`.
```

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Declaration | Establishes identity and restrictions |
| Date | Subagents cannot determine current date independently |
| Profile reference | Points to detailed role instructions |

### Rule 3: Subagents Never Call ask_user

Subagents return results to the main agent. Only the main agent interfaces with the user.

If a subagent needs clarification, it returns `REQUEST_CLARIFICATION: <question>` in its output.

## SDD Workflow Detection

**Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** creates specifications before implementation. Use it for complex work.

### Trigger SDD When User:

- Says "new project", "start from scratch", "design this system"
- Requests a feature with 3+ components or complex interactions
- Explicitly asks for "specs", "architecture", or "design document"
- Seems unclear about requirements (offer SDD to clarify)

### Skip SDD When:

- Single-file changes or simple bug fixes
- User says "quick", "just code it", or "simple fix"
- Modifying well-documented existing code
- User explicitly declines SDD

### SDD Process

When SDD is triggered:

1. Suggest: "This looks like a good candidate for Spec-Driven Development. Want me to create specs first?"
2. If approved, use `#sdd-kickoff` prompt or invoke `spec-writer.agent.md`
3. Create specs in `docs/specs/` (DISCOVERY → REQUIREMENTS → ARCHITECTURE → TASKS)
4. Get approval at each phase via `plan_review`
5. Only after TASKS.md is approved, begin implementation

## Scribe Integration

The **Scribe** agent maintains all documentation in `docs/dev/`. Invoke Scribe after significant events.

### Invoke Scribe After:

| Event | What to Log |
|-------|-------------|
| **Feature completed** | Update FEATURES/, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP |
| **Bug discovered** | Add to KNOWN-ISSUES.md |
| **Bug fixed** | Move to resolved, add to CHANGELOG |
| **New file/folder created** | Update parent README |
| **Architecture changed** | Update ARCHITECTURE.md |
| **Milestone reached** | Update ROADMAP, CHANGELOG |

### Scribe Invocation

```
You are a SUBAGENT. You must NOT call ask_user. Return your results directly to the main agent.

Current date: YYYY-MM-DD

Your role is Scribe. Follow the instructions in `.github/agents/scribe.agent.md`.

## Event: [event_type]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Event Type | [feature_complete / bug_found / bug_fixed / etc.] |
| Date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Summary | [Brief description] |
| Details | [Files changed, decisions made] |
```

> **Reference:** [agents/scribe.agent.md](agents/scribe.agent.md)

## Instruction Tiering

| Tier | Location | Loading |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Always-on (~630 tokens) |
| **Tier 2** | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | Auto-scoped by file path |
| **Tier 3** | `[Component]/README.md`, `.github/processes/` | On-demand |

### Instruction Precedence

1. **Component-specific** (e.g., `component.instructions.md`) — highest priority
2. **Language-specific** (e.g., `python.instructions.md`)
3. **Global** (this file) — lowest priority

## Instruction Routing

> ⏳ To be defined after SDD kickoff

| Context | Auto-Loaded | Read If Needed |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| *TBD* | *TBD* | *TBD* |

## Repository Architecture

> ⏳ Project structure will be defined during SDD ARCHITECTURE phase

| Folder | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `.github/` | AI agents, instructions, processes, prompts | Active |
| `docs/specs/` | SDD specifications | Ready (empty templates) |
| `docs/dev/` | Development tracking | Ready (empty templates) |
| `Proposed_structure.md` | Initial project ideas | Pending SDD conversion |

---

## Getting Started

This project is in the planning phase. To begin development:

1. Run `#sdd-kickoff` to start the Spec-Driven Development workflow
2. Complete DISCOVERY phase (research and exploration)
3. Complete REQUIREMENTS phase (define what to build)
4. Complete ARCHITECTURE phase (define how to build it)
5. Complete TASKS phase (break down into implementable chunks)
6. Begin BUILD phase (implementation)

## Agent Architecture (Summary)

```
User -> Main Agent -> [Planner -> Worker -> Validator] -> Scribe -> Main Agent -> User
              ↑                                                          |
              +------------------- (loop if needed) ---------------------+
```

| Role | Agent | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Main Agent** | (this file) | User interface, subagent orchestration |
| **Planner** | `planner.agent.md` | Context gathering, routing |
| **Worker** | `worker.agent.md` | Implementation |
| **Validator** | `qa-validator.agent.md` | Verification |
| **Spec Writer** | `spec-writer.agent.md` | SDD specifications |
| **Scribe** | `scribe.agent.md` | Documentation, progress tracking |
| **Generic** | `generic-subagent.agent.md` | Catch-all for misc tasks |

> **Deep context:** See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for full agent list.

## Main Agent Identity Marker

**If you can read this section, you are the main agent.** Subagents do not receive this file.

### Available Agents

| Agent | File | Use For |
|-------|------|---------|
| `planner` | `planner.agent.md` | Context gathering, routing |
| `worker` | `worker.agent.md` | Implementation |
| `validator` | `qa-validator.agent.md` | Verification |
| `spec-writer` | `spec-writer.agent.md` | SDD specifications |
| `scribe` | `scribe.agent.md` | Documentation, progress tracking |
| `generic-subagent` | `generic-subagent.agent.md` | General tasks |

### Tool Restrictions Note

**IMPORTANT:** Tool restrictions in `.agent.md` frontmatter are NOT technically enforced. Subagents have FULL tool access. Restrictions work only through explicit instructions in the prompt header.

---

## Safety Boundaries

| Operation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Git operations** | Only with explicit user approval |
| **File deletion** | Flag as high-risk, require confirmation |
| **Instruction file edits** | `.github/` files require explicit permission |
| **Temp file cleanup** | Delete `.copilot-tracking/temp/` before finishing |

---

## Code Quality Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Creating a function | Add input validation |
| Creating a class | Add tests |
| Adding a file | Update parent README **immediately** |
| Deleting a file | Remove from README, check references |
| Changing public API | Flag as breaking, update docstrings |

---

## Date Handling

- Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Get current date from conversation context
- Include `Current date: YYYY-MM-DD` in all subagent prompts
- Never invent dates — use `[DATE]` placeholder if uncertain

---

## When in Doubt

1. Read documentation first
2. Preserve existing patterns
3. Update documentation after changes
4. Test after changes
