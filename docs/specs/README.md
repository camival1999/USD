# Project Specifications

This folder contains Spec-Driven Development (SDD) artifacts.

## Specification Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| [DISCOVERY.md](DISCOVERY.md) | Vision, goals, constraints, stakeholders | Template |
| [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) | Functional & non-functional requirements | Template |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | System design, components, data flow | Template |
| [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) | Implementation breakdown, phases | Template |

## SDD Workflow

```
DISCOVERY → REQUIREMENTS → ARCHITECTURE → TASKS → BUILD
```

Each phase builds on the previous. Complete and approve each spec before moving to the next.

## Using These Templates

1. Run `#sdd-kickoff` to start the SDD wizard
2. Or manually copy templates and fill in project-specific content
3. Use `plan_review` to get approval at each phase
